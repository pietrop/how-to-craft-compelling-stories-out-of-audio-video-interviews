Some sources and resources to explore this further.

### **Michael Tierno , Artistotele's Poetics for screenwriters**

I recommend to read Tierno before reading McKee. For a more gentle introduction, and to better understand McKee.

However there ideas from Aristotele that McKee revisits and takes further such as that of the¬†`action idea`¬†which is later referred to as¬†`inciting incident`. These have settle differences that nonetheless become significant when used in the story crafting context.
